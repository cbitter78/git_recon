# Git Recon

What makes a open source project healthy?  Thats a loaded question. It depends.  It depends on different attributes per project.  Some projects are a single repo, some are many repos.  How can we even tell?

I found my self using GitHub in much the same way to get a "feel" for how healthy a project is.  This project attempts to automate some of these tasks and then present the data in a way where you the human will be able to mentally weigh the trade offs and context to come to your own conclusion.
