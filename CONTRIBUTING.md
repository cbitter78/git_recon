## Development

There are many ways to set up an environment to develop.  If you are experienced you can ignore this section.  It is not a prescription rather a help mate for someone that many not grok this project directly from the source.

I use [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/).  I suggest you do to.  Notice there is a .vscode folder intentionally added to this repo.  I it will include debug and extension preferences.  When using VSCode make sure to install the extension recommendations.

I used python Virtual Environments [(venv) with python 3](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) for this project.  With this I use [requirements.txt](./requirements.txt) for all my python dependencies.  Check out the helper shell script [venv.sh](./venv.sh).  If you are on Linux or Mac you can simply run it.  If you are on windows fill free to figure it out and submit a PR to this doc on how to do that.
